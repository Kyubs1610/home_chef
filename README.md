# HomeChef mobile App

On this team project we made a small app where :

- The customers can order and pick-up the food to the chef place.
- The chefs can prepare food don't need a restaurant and can cook from home.

I worked on the frontend and the design using figma, canva, CSS, Javascript & React
The app can be available on mobile
